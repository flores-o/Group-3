# Group 3 repository

This repository is where all members of group 3 will submit their assignments.

A directory for each group member and assignment should already be present:
please submit your assignments within the corresponding directories.

For group assignments, a `group` directory has been created.

An example assignment submission is present in the `sample` directory.

Remember to create a branch named `<username>-assignment<assignment#>` instead
of submitting to the `master` branch and make a pull request to `master` when
you are ready to submit.
